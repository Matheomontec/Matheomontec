- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matheomontec  
  I'm a French student at the University of Lyon (UCBL), pursuing a Master's in Nanoscale Engineering (Nanotechnology & Nanomaterials).

- 👀 I’m interested in Nanotechnology, R&D in new materials using biomimicry for health or sports, and the development of innovative solutions for real-world problems.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new things every day, and right now I’m focusing on learning Python for data analysis and simulations.

- 💻 My current research involves 3D modeling of proteins, using Python scripts on PyMol, and studying protein dynamics, with a focus on CDC proteins.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R&D in biomimicry for large labs or companies, particularly in sports-related applications or health innovations.
